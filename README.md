# RCSB-Protein-Data-Bank-CSV-Maker
Creates csc files scraped from RCSB-Protein-Data-Bank to store information for later retrieval and searching
The purpose of this project was to create something at the UGA hackathon 2019. I also wanted to work on
webscrapping and create something to enable someone to hold a csv to keep track of which piece of the RCSB 
Protein they wanted to focus on for a particular project. I want to add the ability to set up the csv and 
write it in the format they want for easy accesibilility later.
